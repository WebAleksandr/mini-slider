                    <p class="description">Gul'dan was the first orcish warlock as well as the de facto founder of the
                        Horde. He betrayed
                        both
                        his people and his mentor Ner'zhul to the demon lord Kil'jaeden for personal gain and power, and
                        was
                        directly responsible for the orcs' fall to demonic enslavement and their subsequent invasion of
                        Azeroth. Tutored by the leaders of the Burning Legion, he is considered one of the most powerful
                        warlocks to have ever existed.He founded the Shadow Council and created the first death knights.
                        Gul'dan often referred to himself as "Darkness Incarnate" and "The Destroyer of Dreams.</p>

                    <p class="description">Illidan Stormrage, commonly known as the Betrayer, is the first of the demon
                        hunters, the former
                        self-proclaimed Lord of Outland, the former ruler of the Black Temple, and the original leader
                        of
                        the Illidari. He is the twin brother of Malfurion Stormrage and was, like his sibling, in love
                        with
                        Tyrande Whisperwind. Originally a powerful night elf sorcerer, Illidan officially betrayed his
                        people by defecting to the demonic Burning Legion during the War of the Ancients, though his
                        reasons
                        for doing so were noble as he secretly aimed to repel the Legion's invasion. He eventually
                        returned
                        to the side of his fellow night elves, but his creation of a second Well of Eternity at the end

                        the war caused his people to name him "Betrayer" and imprison him in the Barrow Deeps below
                        Mount
                        Hyjal. There he remained for over 10,000 years, watched over by the warden Maiev Shadowsong and

                        Garrosh Hellscream was a former Warchief of the Horde chosen by Thrall to replace him in the
                        wake of
                        the Cataclysm, until he was succeeded by Vol'jin after the Siege of Orgrimmar. Throughout the
                        history of Azeroth, few mortals have achieved greater notoriety than him.

                    <p class="description">
                        Lady Sylvanas Windrunner, formerly styled "the Dark Lady" and "the Banshee Queen", is the former
                        Warchief of the Horde and former supreme ruler of the Forsaken, one of the most powerful
                        factions of
                        undead on Azeroth. In life, Sylvanas was the ranger-general of Silvermoon, whose leadership
                        acumen
                        and martial prowess were without equal. During the Third War, she bravely defended Quel'Thalas
                        from
                        a Scourge invasion led by the death knight Arthas Menethil. Ultimately, however, Sylvanas fell
                        in
                        battle. Rather than honor the ranger-general with a quick death, Arthas ripped out her soul and
                        transformed it into a banshee: a cunning and vengeful agent of the Lich King empowered by hate.

                    <p class="description">
                        Deathwing the Destroyer,formerly known as Neltharion the Earth-Warder, was one of the five
                        Dragon
                        Aspects and leader of the black dragonflight. Ages ago, Neltharion was empowered by the Pantheon
                        with dominion over the earth and the deep places of Azeroth. However, driven mad by the Old
                        Gods, he
                        turned against the other Aspects during the War of the Ancients, eventually abandoning his title
                        of
                        Aspect of Earth in favor of being the Aspect of Death. Becoming one of the greatest terrors of
                        the
                        known world, his name too became one whispered with a feeling of fear and contempt among both
                        mortals and dragons.He was perhaps the most powerful servant of the Old Gods
